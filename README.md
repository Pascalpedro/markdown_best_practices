# Markdown Syntax!!!
This repo is an overview of the markdown syntax. 

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language widely used for formatting and structuring plain text. It provides a simple and readable syntax that can be easily converted into HTML or other formats.

> The simplicity and versatility of Markdown make it a popular choice for content creation, as it allows you to focus on the content without getting bogged down in complex formatting.

Now, let's analyze some of the fundamental syntax that we will come across in our daily activities.

## HEADINGS:

To create a heading, add a hash sign (#) in front of a word or phrase.  
For example:
# This is a header created with one hash sign!!!

The size of a header is inversely proportional to the number of hash signs introduced. 
This means that: the higher the number of hash signs, the smaller the font size of the header down to the sixth level.  

For example:

## This font size was created with two hash signs.

### This font size was created with three hash signs.
..  
..
###### This font size was created with six hash signs.

`N/B: There should be a space after the hash sign before typing the word or phrase.`
`Also, always put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.`


## PARAGRAPH:

To create a paragraph, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.  
For example:  
This is my first paragraph...

This is my second paragraph...

`N/B: Do not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs unless the paragraph is in a list.`


## LINE BREAK!!!

To create a line break:
- End the line with two or more spaces ("trailing whitespace").  
For example:  
  - This is the first line. 
  - This is the second line. 
  
- Use the `<br>` HTML tag at the end of the sentence.  
  For example:  
  - This is the first line. <br>
  - This is the second line.

  
## EMPHASIS!!!

A text can be made bold or italic by the use of emphasis.  
To get a bold text:
- add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.  
For example:  
  - This is a **bold** text. 
  - This is a __bold__ text. 
  
- to bold the middle of a word, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.  
  For example:  
  - This is a b**ol**d letter.
 
To get an italic text:
- add asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.  
For example:  
  - This is an *italic* text. 
  - This is an _italic_ text. 
  
- to italic the middle of a word, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.  
  For example:  
  - This is an i*tali*c letter.
 
To use bold and italics simultaneously in one sentence:
- add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.
- add two asterisks and one underscore before and after a word.
- add two underscores and one asterisk before and after a word.
For example:  
  - This is a ***bold italic*** text. 
  - This is a ___bold italic___ text.
  - This is a **_bold italic_** text.
  - This is a __*bold italic*__ text.
  
- to bold and italicize the middle of a word, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.  
  For example:  
  - This is a b***ol****d letter.


## BLOCK QUOTES!!!

To create a block quote:
- add a > in front of a paragraph.  
For example:  
> This is an example of a block quote. 

To create blockquotes with multiple paragraphs:
- add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.  
For example:  
> This is a block quote.
>
> This is another block quote.

To create nested block quotes:  
- add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.  
For example:
> This is a
 block quote.
>
>> This is another block quote.

To create blockquotes with other markdown formatted elements:  
> #### This is a block quote!!
>
> - This is a bullet inside a blockquote.
>
> *This* is an emphaisis inside a **blockquote**.

`N/B: For best practices, use blank lines before and after block quotes.
