Now, let's analyze some of the fundamental syntax that we will come across in our daily activities.

## HEADINGS:

To create a heading, add a hash sign (#) in front of a word or phrase.  
For example:
# This is a header created with one hash sign!!!

The size of a header is inversely proportional to the number of hash signs introduced. 
This means that: the higher the number of hash signs, the smaller the font size of the header down to the sixth level.  

For example:

## This font size was created with two hash signs.

### This font size was created with three hash signs.
..  
..
###### This font size was created with six hash signs.

`N/B: There should be a space after the hash sign before typing the word or phrase.`
`Also, always put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.`


## PARAGRAPH:

To create a paragraph, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.  
For example:  
This is my first paragraph...

This is my second paragraph...

`N/B: Do not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs unless the paragraph is in a list.`


## LINE BREAK!!!

To create a line break:
- End the line with two or more spaces ("trailing whitespace").  
For example:  
  - This is the first line. 
  - This is the second line. 
  
- Use the `<br>` HTML tag.  
  For example:  
  - This is the first line. <br>
  - This is the second line.
