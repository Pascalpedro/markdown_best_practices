Now, let's analyze some of the fundamental syntax that we will come across in our daily activities.

## HEADINGS:

To create a heading, add a hash sign (#) in front of a word or phrase.  
For example:
# This is a header created with one hash sign!!!

The size of a header is inversely proportional to the number of hash signs introduced. 
This means that: the higher the number of hash signs, the smaller the font size of the header down to the sixth level.  

For example:

## This font size was created with two hash signs.

### This font size was created with three hash signs.
..  
..
###### This font size was created with six hash signs.

`N/B: There should be a space after the hash sign before typing the word of phrase.`
